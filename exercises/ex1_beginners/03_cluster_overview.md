# Exercise 1.3 Cluster overview

You can find more details about the clusters when using the overview of a single cluster.

1. While you are on the view with the Project Clusters for the project `DEV269`, select one of the clusters by clicking on the cluster name to navigate to the overview page of this cluster.

3. A pop-up will appear with the worker node details for this worker group. These are the parameters that are used by Gardener when managing the worker nodes for that cluster. You will learn how to configure the worker nodes for a cluster in the next section with exercises offered for this workshop.
