# Exercise 1.2 Create your first Gardener Project

Gardener project is one of the main Gardener resources. It is used to group Gardener managed Kubernetes clusters (shoot clusters) for common administative activities like, for example, members management, provider secrets configuration, etc.

When using Gardener, Kuberentes clusters are always created as associated to a concrete Gardener project.
